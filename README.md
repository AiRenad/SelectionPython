## Setup and Tutorial

### 1. Setup

#### 1.1. Install Git (Windows Users Only)

- [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### 1.2. Install Python

##### 1.2.1. Windows (Using Chocolaty)

- Open powershell as an administrator.

  ![Alt text](/readme/image16.png)

- Run the following command to install Chocolaty:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

- Run the following command to install Python:

```bash
choco install python
```

- Check if Python is installed properly by running the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

##### 1.2.2. MacOS (Using Homebrew)

By default, python is already installed in macOS systems. However, if you want to use the latest version of python, you can install it using Homebrew.

- Open the terminal.
![Alt text](/readme/image15.png)
- Run the following command to install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- Run the following command to install Flutter:

```bash
brew install python
```

![Alt text](/readme/image4.png)

- Check if Python is installed properly by running the following command:

```bash
python3.X --version
```

where `X` is the version of python you installed.

#### 1.3. Install VS Code

- [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

#### 1.4 Fork the repository

- Fork the repository by clicking the fork button on the top right corner of the repository page.
  - Click the fork Button

  ![Image of forking the repository](./readme/image.png)

  - Name the repo and click "Create fork"
  ![Alt text](/readme/image25.png)

  - You should now have a copy of the repository on your own account.

### Tutorial

#### 2.1. Git

##### 2.1.1. Clone the repository

- Open the terminal and navigate to the directory (also known as folder) where you want to clone the repository.
  - Make sure the path you choose has NO ARABIC LETTERS. This will cause errors.
    - On Mac:
  ![Alt text](/readme/image17.png)
    - On Windows:
  ![Alt text](/readme/image20.png)
- Go to the repository page on **your own account** and click on the green code button.
- Copy the link under the clone section.
![Image of github](/readme/image1.png)
- Run the following command inside of the opened terminal to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <The Link from your Repository>
```

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/Selection-Project.git
```

![Alt text](./readme/image3.png)

##### 2.1.2. Add changes

- Open the repository directory in VS Code.
  - The path must be INSIDE the cloned repository.
  - Click on File -> Open folder
  ![Alt text](/readme/image21.png)
  - Select the repository folder.
  ![Alt text](/readme/image22.png)
  - The repository should be opened in VS Code.
  ![Alt text](/readme/image18.png)
  - To make sure, run the following command in the terminal INSIDE Vscode:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

  - The output should be similar to the following:

#### 2.2. Python

You can find starter python tutorials [here](./Tutorial/).

##### 2.2.6. Code Structuring and Formatting

- Code should be structured and formatted properly.
- Code should be divided into functions and classes.
- Functions and classes should be named properly.
- Functions and classes should be defined before they are used.

An example code structure is provided within the repository itself.

## Project Overview

Your task is to create a Sentiment Analyzer program using reviews from either a movie, book, or game that you like. You can use whatever method you please to scrape data from the internet. The final submission should be a jupyter notebook analyzing the reviews of the movie, book, or game you chose.

An example of a sentiment analyzer can be found [here](https://github.com/Radwan-Albahrani/Sentiment-Analyzer).

### Requirements

The notebook should contain the following:

- A description of the project.
- A description of the dataset used.
- A description of the methods used to scrape the data.
- A description of the methods used to analyze the data.
- A description of the results.

Some libraries that you might find useful:

- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)
- [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
- [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

## Submission Guidelines

- The app should be pushed to Github and a pull request should be created. You can check how to push your code to Github in section [2.1.2 Add Changes](#212-add-changes)
- The pull request title should be in the following format: `<your-name> - <project-name>`. You can check how to make a pull request in section [2.1.5. Create a pull request](#215-create-a-pull-request).
- The pull request description should contain the following:
  - A description of the changes made.
  - A screenshot of the app running in the terminal.
